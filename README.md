# Simple Calculator
For this project I was tasked with creating a functional calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ensuring that I used best codes of practise throughout. The calculator itself had to accept a minimum of two inputs, perform an operation and return the output. I adopted a mobile-first approach to the design of this calculator, making it responsive to different devices. It is modelled on a standard calculator app and I designed it first in FIGMA before implementing the design in CSS using grid to create the main body of the calculator.

# What I used:
•	JavaScript

# Design
I built this calculator with a mobile-first approach, making it responsive to different devices. It is modelled on a standard calculator app. I designed it first in FIGMA before I implemented the design in CSS using grid to create the main body of the calculator.

# Functionality
•	As you would expect from a basic calculator, this performs equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, returning the result in the display.

•	The display itself is split into two Divs – currentOperand and previousOperand – which allows the screen to display the expression in the top half and the answer in the bottom half.

•	When it comes to deleting integers or the whole screen, the Del button has been given the functionality to delete the last digit, whereas the AC button can clears the display completely.
